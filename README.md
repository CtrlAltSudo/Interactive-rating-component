## What I learnt 

This is my first Javascript challenge by Frontend Mentor, the javascript took a long time to figure out and I had to resort to ChatGPT on a few occasions but eventually got there. I learned that there are more event listeners, I now know that "mouseover" is really useful, I couldn't figure how to get the hover CSS class to stop taking an affect on a selected li element until ChatGPT introduced me to mouseover listener.
